Project Overview
This project simulates a Smart City environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary focus is to demonstrate the integration and management of various IoT devices and networking technologies to create an efficient, automated, and smart urban infrastructure. The project includes the implementation of a smart parking management system to monitor and control the availability of parking spaces in real-time.

Features
Smart Parking Management:

Real-time monitoring of parking space availability.
Automated updates of parking status on a web interface.
Dynamic color-coded indicators for parking spots (green for free, red for occupied).
Network Setup:

UDP communication for data transmission between devices.
HTTP server for serving the web interface.
IoT Integration:

Sensors to detect the presence of vehicles in parking spots.
Real-time data processing and updates.
Components
IoT Sensors: Used to detect the presence of vehicles in each parking space.
Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and communicates with the network.
UDP Socket: Facilitates data transmission over the network.
HTTP Server: Hosts the web interface for monitoring parking space status.
Web Interface: Displays the status of each parking spot in real-time.
Setup Instructions
Requirements
Cisco Packet Tracer (version 7.2 or later)
Basic understanding of IoT and networking concepts
Steps
Open Cisco Packet Tracer: Launch the application on your computer.

Load the Project File: Open the provided Packet Tracer project file (SmartCity.pkt).

Configure Network Devices:

Ensure all devices are correctly connected as per the network topology.
Verify the IP addresses and other network configurations.
Setup IoT Devices:

Place the IoT sensors in each parking space.
Connect the sensors to the microcontroller.
Configure UDP Socket:

Set the destination IP (192.168.0.100) and port (1234) for UDP communication.
Start the HTTP Server:

Ensure the HTTP server is running and listening on port 80.
Deploy the Web Interface:

Access the web interface through a browser to monitor the parking status.
Simulate Parking Activity:

Use the simulation mode in Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize and test the functionality of the smart parking system.
Usage
Monitoring Parking Spaces:

Open a web browser and navigate to the HTTP server's IP address.
View the real-time status of each parking spot on the web interface.
Updating Parking Status:

The system automatically updates the parking status every few seconds.
The color of each parking spot changes based on availability (green for free, red for occupied).
Troubleshooting
No Data on Web Interface:

Ensure the HTTP server is running and accessible.
Check the UDP socket configuration and ensure data is being transmitted.
Incorrect Parking Status:

Verify the connections between sensors and the microcontroller.
Check the sensor readings and ensure they are accurate.
Future Enhancements
Expand to More Parking Spots: Increase the number of monitored parking spots.
Integrate Other Smart City Features: Add more IoT devices for traffic management, street lighting, etc.
Enhanced Analytics: Implement data analytics for better city planning and management.
